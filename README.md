# My Research

### No-Existence Of Generalized Diffusion.
We have used a known lower bound over the round's number required to compute the disjoiuntness in two-party (quantum) computation setting
to show the impossibility of projecting over a given general state (literally given, without the classical description).

Even though this fact might seem 
trivial, we have found it hard to prove by the standard methods (i.e., showing non-linearity as in the no cloning). 
However, the contradiction of preview communication results is obtained almost immediately. This [draft](https://github.com/dudupo/Academic/blob/master/projects/pdfs/lowerbound.pdf) is in an advanced stage, and I hope to 
publish a formal version of it soon :information_desk_person:. 

### Cutting the Depth Factor Of Hamiltonian Simulation Circuit. 
Here we are trying to figure out what can be done to generate an efficient simulation circuit assuming the Hamiltonian has already 
given in the computational base. The goal of this direaction is to yield a technics that might be used one day to perform a practical computation.
Hence we allow ourselves to assume properties such as the distribution over the local terms along it match the expected behavior of nature. 
The [draft](https://github.com/dudupo/Academic/blob/master/projects/pdfs/Classiq.pdf) is
far from being complete and contains mistakes, faults, and alternations in the notation :see_no_evil:.

### Local Testability and qPCP. (Currently My Main Project). 
Making baby steps towards the holy grill. It's clear that there is a deep connection between CSS orthogonality and 
Local testibility. As we have local decodibility of low erorr weight since the imerging of the good codes themselfs, 
The testability problem is reduced for testing high weigh errors. In the mean time, proving that $C_{x}, C_{z}$ are CSS pair 
obtains upperbond on the the weight of codewords in $C_{z}^{\perp}$ , Furthemore the squares complex of the recent constructions 
gurrentes that the result of local views correction is a code word of $C_{x}$. 

We are trying to figuring out how one canlift the diminsion of the complex to obtain a system in which the $C_{x}$ 
is also subspace of larger code $C_{w}$. We are still not there yet, but the work is starting to come into shap. Noitce that that Lemma 2 is completle nonscence (And the probabiliy not the only fault). [draft](https://github.com/dudupo/Academic/blob/master/projects/pdfs/ltc_v2.pdf).    

### Quantum version of FLP impossibility. 
We are trying to formulate reliability in a quantum distributed environment,
hoping to reach a quantum version of Stren proof for the impossibility of doing
a asynchronic computation without a non-vanishing probability of non-terminating running.
