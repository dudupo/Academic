### No-Existence Of Generalized Diffusion.
We have used a known lower bound over the round's number required to compute the disjoiuntness in two-party (quantum) computation setting
to show the impossibility of projecting over a given general state (literally given, without the classical description).

Even though this fact might seem 
trivial, we have found it hard to prove by the standard methods (i.e., showing non-linearity as in the no cloning). 
However, the contradiction of preview communication results is obtained almost immediately. This [draft](https://github.com/dudupo/Academic/blob/master/projects/pdfs/lowerbound.pdf) is in an advanced stage, and I hope to 
publish a formal version of it soon :information_desk_person:. 

### Cutting the Depth Factor Of Hamiltonian Simulation Circuit. 
Here we are trying to figure out what can be done to generate an efficient simulation circuit assuming the Hamiltonian has already 
given in the computational base. The goal of this direaction is to yield a technics that might be used one day to perform a practical computation.
Hence we allow ourselves to assume properties such as the distribution over the local terms along it match the expected behavior of nature. 
The [draft](https://github.com/dudupo/Academic/blob/master/projects/pdfs/Classiq.pdf) is
far from being complete and contains mistakes, faults, and alternations in the notation :see_no_evil:.
