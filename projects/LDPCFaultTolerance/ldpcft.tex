\title{Idea For FT computing.} 
\author{David Ponarovsky}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item encode $k$ qubit in $[n,10k, d]$ good qLDPC code. With a reducing Lemma for threshold $l$.  
  \item implement $X,Z,H,T$ in the straightforward way.  
  \item The $CX$, need more attention. Denote by $g_{i}$ a generator of $C$ and notice that we took only $1/10$-fraction of the generator in the encoding process. Now, any $CX$ will be followed by correction step. The idea we stretch a wire according  predetermined match between the qubits in the support of $g_{i}$ and the qubits in the support of $g_{j}$.    
  \item  As we took only a fraction of the code space, we can require that any codeword spanned by the $g_{j}$'s has an overlap with $g_{i}$ which less than $l/3$. Or in other words, the decoder can correct a non desire $CX$ in single step $\sim$.
