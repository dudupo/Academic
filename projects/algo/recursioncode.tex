\section{Construction.}
\begin{definition} 
  Let $\Delta$ be an integer greater than $2$ and consider an alogrithm $\mathcal{A}$ that for any $n$ that is power of $3$ construct a $\Delta$-regular graph over $n$ vertices. Now, let $G$ be $\Delta$-regular graph over $n$ vertices generated by $\mathcal{A}$. Define the \bf{third graph obtained by $G$}, labeled by $G^{\sim}$ to be the graph which $\mathcal{A}$ returns over $\frac{1}{3} n$ such that any of the edges could be associate by puncturing a $\frac{2}{3}$ fraction of the egdges of each vertex.  
\end{definition}

\paragraph{The Code.} Let $C\left( \frac{1}{2}\Delta n \right)$ be the code defiend by the joiningthe parity check matrix of a Tanner code over $\Delta$-regular graph and
