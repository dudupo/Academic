  Quantum feasibility hinges on the assumption that the basic gate's noise rate is below a certain threshold. Here we study the behavior of computation models when the noise is slightly greater than that threshold. In particular, We ask if one can design a fault tolerance schema such that if the noise is above the threshold, it is still grunted that the final generated state would have a value.
