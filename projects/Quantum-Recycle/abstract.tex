\begin{abstract} 
Quantum feasibility depends on the assumption that the basic gate's noise rate is below a certain threshold. Here, we study the behavior of computation models when the noise is slightly higher than that threshold. In particular, we ask if one can design a fault tolerance schema such that, even if the noise is above the threshold, the final generated state still has a value.
