\definition[General Entanglement State]{ We say that $\PSI$ is general entanglement \label{def:gEnt} if .. }

\definition[Local-Measure-Circuit] { We say that a quantum circuit $C$ is a local measure circuit \label{def:lmc} if it's can be described as a decomposition of poly classical circuit and a constant depth quantum circuit which contains only 1-qubit gates and measurements. 

We would think about local measure circuits as chip circuits. }

\definition[$p_{0}-\Delta$ Fault Tolerance Circuit]{ We say that $\mathcal{C}$ is $p_{0}-\Delta$ fault tolerance \label{def:gft} presentation of abstract circuit $C$ if there exists a local measure circuit $C_{0}$ \ref{def:lmc} such it's grunted that for noise $p < p_{0}$ $\mathcal{C}$ compute $C$ w.h.p,
And in addition, if $p \in \left( p_{0}, p_{0} + \varepsilon \right)$ then by applying a $C_{0}$ on $\mathcal{C}$ output yields a general entanglement state \ref{def:gEnt}}       

\ctt{We would like to add a complexity parameter for the above definition, for example, ``a general entanglement state over more than $\frac{1}{5}$ of the qubits.}
