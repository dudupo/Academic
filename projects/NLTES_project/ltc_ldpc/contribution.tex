  Nowadays, we are aware of a wide range of constructions yield good codes, including the expander codes of Sipser and Spilman \cite{ExpanderCodes} and the LTC codes of Dinur \cite{Dinur}, \cite{Pavel}, \cite{leverrier2022quantum}. Thus if a decade ago, the main question was the existence of a good code and its construction, now, and particularly in this work, we concentrate on getting a deep understanding of what makes those constructions work. By utilizing those insights, we succussed in achieving significantly simpler construction. Our results: 

 \begin{theorem*}[Theorem 1] There exist a constant $\alpha > 0$ and an infinte family of Tanner Codes $C = \Tann$ such that any ireducable codeword $x$ of a coresponding disagreement code $x \in C_{\oplus}$ at length $n$, weight at least $\alpha n$. \end{theorem*}

\begin{theorem*}[Theorem 1+] There exist a constant $\alpha > 0 $ and infinite familiy of codes which satesfies Theroem 1 and also good.
  \end{theorem*}
