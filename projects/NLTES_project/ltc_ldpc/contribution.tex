  Nowadays, we are aware of a wide range of constructions yield good codes, including the expander codes of Sipser and Spilman \cite{ExpanderCodes} and the LTC codes of Dinur \cite{Dinur}, \cite{Pavel}, \cite{leverrier2022quantum}. Thus if a decade ago, the main question was the existence of a good code and its construction, now, and particularly in this work, we concentrate on getting a deep understanding of what makes those constructions work. By utilizing those insights, we succussed in achieving significantly simpler construction. Our results: 

  \begin{theorem} \label{thm} For every $\varepsilon > 0 $ there is a family of good LDPC codes with $\Theta\left( n^{1-\varepsilon} \right)$ testability. 
  \end{theorem}
