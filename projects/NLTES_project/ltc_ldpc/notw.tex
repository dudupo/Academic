\section{The Polynomial-Code Is Not $w$-Robust.}
One idea for constructing is to use the polynomial code instead of $C_{0}$. This follows from the fact that if one picks a degree strictly greater than $\Delta/2$, then $C_{0}^{\perp} \subset C_{0}$ and therefore one could choose $C_{z}$ to be the same code defined on the negative vertices of the graph.  Here we prove that the dual-tensor code, in that case, is not $w$-robust, meaning that any such construction should be considered another way of proving the Reduction Lemma.

%We can construct a dual-tensor code by using a polynomial code instead of $C_{0}$. This is because if we choose a degree strictly greater than $\Delta/2$, then $C_{0}^{\perp} \subset C_{0}$. This means that we can choose $C_{z}$ to be the same code defined on the negative vertices of the graph. However, this construction is not $w$-robust, meaning that it does not satisfy the Reduction Lemma. Therefore, we must consider other methods of proving the Reduction Lemma.

\begin{claim}
  \label{claim:poldu}
  Let $C_{0}$ be the $[\Delta,d, \Delta-d]$ polynomial code. Then any code word in $\left( C_{0}^{\perp} \otimes C_{0}^{\perp} \right)^{\perp}$ is a polynomial in $F[x,y]$ at degree at most $\Delta + d$
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
Consider base element $ C_{0} \otimes \mathbb{F} $, denote it by $c = g_{i} \otimes e_{j}$. And notice that $c$ has representation in $F[x,y]$ of $\prod_{y^{\prime} \neq j}{\left( y - y^{\prime} \right) }g_{i}\left( x \right)$. By the fact that $g_{i}\left( x \right) \in C_{0} $ we have that degree of $c$ is at most $\Delta + \delta$. Hence any element in the subspace of $C_{0} \otimes \mathbb{F}$ is a polynomial at degree at most $\Delta + d$.   
\end{proof}

\begin{claim}
  \label{claim:nowr} The dual-tensor polynomial code is not $\Delta^{1 +\varepsilon}$-robust, for any $\varepsilon > 0$.  
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
Consider the following polynomial 
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
%      & P(x,y) = \Delta - 1 + \mathbf{1}_{ x = y } \\ 
      P(x,y) = \prod_{i \neq \Delta - 1}{ \left( x + i y \right)  }=\prod_{i \neq  1}{ \left( x - i y \right)  }  
         \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
  The degree of any monomial is at most $\Delta-1$, Thus it clear that $P \in \left( C_{0}^{\perp} \otimes C_{0}^{\perp} \right)^{\perp}$. And by the fact that for any $x \neq y$ there exists $i\neq 1 $ such that $x = iy$ we have that $P(x,y) = 0$. Hence the weight of $P$ is at most $|\{ (x,y) : x = y \}|= \Delta$. Yet, for any $x = y$ it follows:      
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
       P(x,x) = \prod_{i \neq \Delta - 1}{ \left( x + i x \right)  }= x^{\Delta-1}\prod_{i \neq \Delta - 1}{ \left( 1 + i \right) } = \left( \Delta-1 \right)!  =_{\Delta} -1  \neq_{\Delta} 0 
    \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
  Put it differently, the diagonal of the matrix, and only it, has only non-zero values, therefore the $P$ cannot decompised to a sum of $s + t$ such that $s \in C_{0}\otimes \mathbb{F}$, $t \in \mathbb{F}\otimes C_{0}$ and $s$ ($t$) is supported at most of $\Delta^{\varepsilon}$ rows (columns). But, $P$ is a codeword of the dual tensor code at weight less than $\Delta^{1 + \varepsilon}$. So, the dual-tensor polynomial code is not a $w$-robust code,  for $w = \Delta^{1 +\varepsilon}$.

\begin{openproblem} 
Is there a quantum CSS code that is also $\Delta^{1\frac{1}{2}}+ \varepsilon$-robust, for some $\varepsilon > 0$ ? And if so, can it be set on the square complex such that all the checks still commute?
