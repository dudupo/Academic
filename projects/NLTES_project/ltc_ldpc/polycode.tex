\section{Polynomial Code.} Consider the field $\FF$ for an arbitrary prime power $q$ greater than $n$. The polynomial codes rely on the fact that any two different polynomials in the ring $\FF\left[ x \right]$ of degree at most $d$ differ by at least $q - d + 1$ points. For example, consider a pair of polynomials of degree 1, namely two linear straight lines. If they are not identical, then they have at most one intersection point, and they disagree on each of the $n-1$ remaining points. By defining the code to be the subspace containing all polynomials of degree at most $d$, such that any codeword is an image of such a polynomial encoded by $n$ numbers, we can guarantee a lower bound on the code's distance. Formally, we define:
\begin{definition}[Polynomial Code. \cite{Reed1960PolynomialCO}]
  Fix $m > n $ to be a prime power and let $a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots a_{n}$ distinct points of the field $\FF$  and define the code $C$ as follows:  
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
      C = \left\{p\left(a_{0}\right),p\left(a_{1}\right),p\left(a_{2}\right),\cdots p\left(a_{n}\right) : p \text{ is polynomial at degree at most } d \right\}
    \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
\end{definition}
Observe that $C$ is a linear code of length $n$ over the alphabet $\FF$. The following Lemma states the relation between the maximal degree of the polynomials and the properties of the code.
\begin{lemma}
Fix the degree of the polynomial code to be at most $d$. Then the parameters of the code are $[n, d+1, n-d]$.
  \label{polycode}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The dimension of the code is equal to the dimension of the polynomial space of degree at most $d$, which is spanned by the monomial basis $e_{0}, e_{1}, e_{2}, \dots, e_{d} = 1, x, \dots, x^{d}$, and is therefore $d+1$. Furthermore, suppose that $f$ and $g$ are two different polynomials, i.e. $f \neq g$. Thus, $h = f-g$ is a non-zero polynomial of degree at most $d$, and therefore has at most $d$ roots. This implies that there are at most $d$ points in which $f$ and $g$ are equal, and at least $n-d$ points in which they disagree. In other words, the distance between any two different codewords of the code is at least $n-d$.
