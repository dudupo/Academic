\subsection{Polynomial Code.} Consider the field $\mathbb{F}_{m}$ for an arbitrary prime power $m=q^{l}$ greater than $n$. The polynomial codes relay on the fact that any two different polynomials in the ring $\mathbb{F}_{m}\left[ x \right]$ at degree at most $d$ different by at least $m - d + 1$ points. For example consider a polynomials pair at degree 1, namely two linear straight lines. If they are not identical than they have at most single intersection point, and the disagree on each of the $n-1$ remaining points.  

So by define the code to be the subspace contains all the polynomials at degree at most $d$, in such way that any codeword is an image of such polynomail encoded by $n$ numbers, one can garntee a lower bound on the code's distance. Formally we define:     
\begin{definition}[Polynomial Code. \cite{Reed1960PolynomialCO}]
  Fix $m > n $ to be a prime power and let $a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\ldots a_{n}$ distinct points of the field $\mathbb{F}_{m} = R$  and define the code $C \subset R $ as follows:  
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
      C = \left\{p\left(a_{0}\right),p\left(a_{1}\right),p\left(a_{2}\right),\cdots p\left(a_{n}\right) : p \text{ is polynomial at degree at most } d \right\}
    \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
  Observes that $C$ is a linear code at length $n$ over the aleph-bet $\mathbb{F}_{m}$. 
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}
  Fix the degree of the polynomial code to be at most $d$. Then the parameters of the code are $[n,d + 1, n - d]$.  
  \label{polycode}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  The dimension of the code equals to the dimension of the polynomials space at degree at most $d$ which is spanned by the vectors $e_{1}, e_{2} .. e_{d} = 1, x .. x^{d}$ and therefore is $d+1$. In addition suppose that $f,g$ are different polynomials i.e $f\neq g$.

  Hence $h = f-g$ is a non-$0$ polynomial at degree at most $d$ and therefore has at most $d$ roots. Namely at most $d$ points in which $f$ equals $g$ and at least $n-d$ in which they disagree. Put in another way the distance between any two different codewords of the code is at least $n-d$.  
\end{proof}
