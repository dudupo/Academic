  Apart from distance and rate here, we interest also that the checking process will be robust. In particular,  we wish that against significant errors, forgetting to perform a single check will sabotage the entire computation only with a tiny probability.  
  \begin{definition} \label{LTC} Consider a code $C$  a string $x$, and denote by $\xi\left( x \right)$ the fraction of the checks in which $x$ fails. $C$ will be called a \textbf{local-testability $f\left( n \right)$} If there exists $\kappa > 0$ such that 
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
      \frac{d\left( x, C \right)}{n} \le \kappa \cdot  \xi\left( x \right) f\left( n \right)
    \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
\end{definition}
