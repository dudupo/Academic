\section{Good Quantum Codes, logaritmic-check-weight.} 
In the following section we will construct a family of complexes on which we will define a pairs of Tanner Codes, evently, they will used to compose a CSS pairs of good quantum codes.  

\begin{definition}{Abelian Square Complex}
  Let $\Gamma$ be abelian group at order $|\Gamma| = n$. And consider a disjointness subsets pair $A,B \subset \Gamma$. Define the generators set $S_{\pm}  = \left\{ b^{\pm 1} a : a \in A, b \in B   \right\}$. 
\end{definition}

\paragraph{Inifinte Family Of Tanner Quantum Codes.} 
Let $p$ be a prime and $\delta \in \left( 0,1 \right)$. Consider the Cayly graphs obtained by taking uniformly a $c\left( \delta \right)\log n$ generators of the cyclic group at order $p$, denote that set by $S$. It was shown by N.Alon \ctt{cite Noga} that with high probability that process yield a Graph with $\delta$-algebric expansion. Now, consider the double cover of that graph and denote it by $G = \left( V = V^{+} \cup V^{-},E \right)$. And define the folowing graph denoted by $\Gamma^{\pm} = \left(V^{\pm}, E^{\prime}\right)$:
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \left( \left(u , \pm  \right), \left( v, \pm \right) \right) \in  E^{\prime} \Leftrightarrow \exists a\neq b \in S \ s.t \ abu = v     
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}
