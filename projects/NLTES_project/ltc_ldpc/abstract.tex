\abstract{We propose an alternative simple construction of good LTC codes. In contrast to previews, constructions made by \cite{Dinur}, \cite{leverrier2022quantum} and \cite{Pavel}, our construction doesn't require spicel properties of the small codes, such as $w$-robustness and $p$-resistance for puncturing.
