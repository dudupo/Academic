\section{Preambles}
  In this work, we propose a new construction for good LDPC codes, which also have a good testability parameter. In the sense that verfining a constant number of random checks, would be enough to detect any error with probability proportional to the error size. In contrast to previews, constructions made by \cite{Dinur}, \cite{leverrier2022quantum} and \cite{Pavel}, our construction doesn't require spicel properties of the small codes, such as $w$-robustness and $p$-resistance for puncturing. 
  
  Our proof also indirectly answers the following question. Why most of the good LDPC codes are known to be bad in terms of detecting errors? In other words, It seems that for most of them, there exist strings that are very far from being in the code and, meanwhile, fail to satisfy only a small number of restrictions.
  While the previous LDPC constructions focused on ensuring that the yielded code would have a good rate and distance parameters, our construction enforces the restrictions collection to have a nontrivial fraction of degeneration. That is, removing a single restriction will not change the code, as any restriction is linearly dependent on the others.
