% \text{ if the row (col) } [uv] \text{ weight is } \Teta\left( \Delta \right) 
Denote by $\Gtt$ the graph obtained by $\Gtt  = \left\{ \left\{ u^{-}, v^{+} \right\}  \right\} $. By the assumption that $x$ is not a reducible we have that there exists $\gamma$ ( $ 1- \frac{1}{2}\delta$  )  such that the degree of any negative vertex in $\Gtt$ is less than $\gamma\Delta$. Denote by $S$ and $T$ the subsets of positive and the negative vertices on the support of $x$. By counting arguments we obtain that: 
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    |S| 2\Delta \ge E|_{\Gtt} \ge \gamma \Delta |T| \Rightarrow \frac{|S|}{|T|} \ge \frac{\gamma}{2}
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}
We could also think on $S$ the normal vertices defined at \cite{leverrier2022quantum} (as been with positive degree in $\Gtt$ equivalence for been connected with heavy edge. On the other hand that quotient is also lower bound for the average degree of the negative vertices, Since $E_{\Gtt}(S,T)/|T| \ge |S|/|T| \ge \gamma/2$. For any random variable $X$ such that $X \le \Delta$ we have that: 

  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
      \prb{X\le x}x+\prb{X > x}\Delta\ge \expp{X}\Rightarrow\prb{X \ge \frac{1}{2} \expp{X} } \ge \frac{\expp{X}}{2\Delta}
    \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
