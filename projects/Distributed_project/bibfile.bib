    abstract = { We prove a near optimal round-communication tradeoff for the two-party quantum communication complexity of disjointness. For protocols with \$r\$ rounds, we prove a lower bound of \$\tilde{\Omega}(n/r + r)\$ on the communication required for computing disjointness of input size \$n\$, which is optimal up to logarithmic factors. The previous best lower bound was \$\Omega(n/r^2 + r)\$ due to Jain, Radhakrishnan and Sen [Proceedings of FOCS, 2003, pp. 220--229]. Along the way, we develop several tools for quantum information complexity, one of which is a lower bound for quantum information complexity in terms of the generalized discrepancy method. As a corollary, we get that the quantum communication complexity of any Boolean function \$f\$ is at most \$2^{O(QIC(f))}\$, where \$QIC(f)\$ is the prior-free quantum information complexity of \$f\$ (with error \$1/3\$). }
