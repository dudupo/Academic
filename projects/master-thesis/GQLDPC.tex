\chapter{Good qLDPC Codes and LTC.}


The exiteness of Good qLDPC codes and LTC were considered an open problems for roughly two decades. And even those, it seems that they related only by containing the word code in their title, they proven to be exist by the same construction. First apper in \cite{Dinur} as good localy testable code and not to long after that in \cite{Pavel}, in which they also extand and derive the resoult to obtian the quantum code. Yet, here, we would follow the \cite{leverrier2022quantum} works, who simplfies the oringal proof.  


\section{Quantum Tanner Codes.}
We are now ready to present the Good qLDPC codes.   
  
  \begin{definition} Let $C = \Tann$. We say that $x \in C_{\oplus}$ is \textbf{reducible} if there exists a vertex $v$ and a small codeword $c_v$, for which, adding the assignment of $c_v$ over the $v$'s edges to $x$ decreases the weight. Namely, $|x + c_{v}| < |x|$. If $x \in C_{\oplus}$ is not a reducible codeword then we say that $x$ is \textbf{irreducible} \label{ire}. \end{definition}


\begin{definition}[$w$-Robustness] Let $C_{0}$ be code of length $\Delta$ with minimum distance $\delta_{0}\Delta$. $C = C_{0} \otimes \mathbb{F} + \mathbb{F}\otimes C_{0}^{\perp}$ will be said $w$-robust if any codeword $c \in C$ at weight less than $w$ it follows that $c$ is supported on at most $2\cdot w/\delta_{0}\Delta$ rows and cols.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[$p$-Resistance to Puncturing.] Let $p,w$ be integers. We will say that the dual tensor code $C_{A} \otimes \mathbb{F} + \mathbb{F} \otimes C_{B}$ is $w$-robust with $p$-resistance to puncturing, if the code obtained by removing (puncturing) a subset of at most $p$ rows and columns is $w$-robust.   
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
  For $\varepsilon \in \left( 0,\frac{1}{2} \right)$, $\gamma\in \left( \frac{1}{2} + \varepsilon, 1 \right)$, $\delta_{0}> 0$, large enough $\Delta$, and small codes $C_{A},C_{B}$ with distance at least $\delta_{0}\Delta$ if the dual tensor code of $C_{A},C_{B}$ is $w$-robust and $\Delta^{\gamma}$ resistance to puncturing, then there exists an infinite family of square complexes for which the Tanner code defined by the complexes and the dual tensor code such that any codeword with weigh less than $ \frac{\delta_{0} n}{4\Delta^{3/2 + \varepsilon}} $ is reducible \cref{ire}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{claim}
  Consider a codeword $c$ such there exists a negative vertex $v$ that adjoins only for normal vertices. Then $c$ is reducible, and there exits $y \in C_{A}^{\perp}\otimes C_{B}^{\perp}$ such that $y$ supported only on $v$ and $ | c_{v} + y | < |c_{v}| $.       
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
  Any row in the local view of $v$ can be thought as a codeword of $C_{B}$ plus faults made by adding $C_{A}\otimes \mathbb{F}_{2}$ to the corresponding sibling of $v$ regarding the row. As the dual tensor is $\Delta^{3/2+\varepsilon}$ robust. Then, \cite{kalachev2022twosided}       
\end{proof}


\begin{claim}
  The distance of the dual tensor code is at least $\delta\Delta$.
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
  By the robustness any codeword with weight less than $\delta_{0}\Delta$ supported on at most one row. Now as the multiplication with any code word of $C_{A}^\perp \otimes C_{B}^\perp$ can be decomposed to a pairwise multiplication over the rows We obtain that only non trivial row must to be in $ \left( C_{B}^{\perp} \right)^{\perp}$ and there fore at weight at least $\delta_{0}\Delta$ and that is contradiction.  
\end{proof}

\begin{claim}
  \label{claim:epss}
  for any $\varepsilon \in \left( 0,1 \right)$ and large enough $\Delta$  it holds that $ |S| \le \Delta^{\varepsilon}|T| $ 
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose not, namely that $|S| > \Delta^{\varepsilon}|T|$, then $|x|/|T| > \Delta^{\varepsilon}|x|/|S| > \Delta^{\varepsilon} \cdot \delta_{0}\Delta $ But:  
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \frac{|x|}{|T|} = \frac{\Theta \left(E(T,T) \right)}{|T|} \le \Theta(\Delta^{2})\frac{|T|}{n}  + \Theta(\Delta)  \rightarrow_{n\rightarrow \infty} \Theta(\Delta)
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}
\end{proof}

\begin{claim}
  There is a negative vertex which adjoins to only normal vertices. 
\end{claim}
% Define the graph $G^{\star} = (V_{-}, E^{\star})$ such that $E^{\star} = E \cup \left\{ \left\{g, xyg \right\} x\neq y, \in A\cup B \right\}$ And notice that the assumption follows that  any 
\begin{proof}
  Denote by $S_{e},S_{n}$ the exceptional and the normal vertices. Namely the weight of the local view for any vertex in $S_{e}$ is grater than $\Delta^{3/2 + \varepsilon}$, and the normal vertices is the complementary vertices set. Suppose through contradiction that any negative vertex $v_{-}\in V_{-}$ has at least one sibling in $S_{e}$. Therefore $|T| \le \Delta |S_{e}|$ combining with \cref{claim:epss} it follows that $|S| \le \Delta^{1+\varepsilon}|S_{e}|$ : 
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
      \Delta^{3/2 + \varepsilon} & \le \frac{E(S,S_{e})}{|S_{e}|} = \Theta\left( \Delta^{2} \right)\frac{|S|}{n} + \Theta\left( \Delta \right)\sqrt{ \frac{|S|}{|S_{e}|}  }\\ 
      & \le \Theta(\Delta^{2}) \frac{|S|}{n} + \Theta(\Delta) \Theta\left( \Delta^{\frac{1+\varepsilon}{2}} \right)  
    \end{split}
  \end{equation*} 
 \end{proof}

\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \begin{matrix}
   \alpha  |S_{e}|  \le &\theta^{2}\frac{|S_{e}||S|}{|V|} - \lambda^{2}\sqrt{ |S_{e}||S| } \\
   \beta |T|   \le  &2\theta \frac{|T||S|}{2|V|} +2 \lambda\sqrt{ |T||S| }  
 \end{matrix}
 & \Rightarrow \begin{matrix}
 |S_{e}|  \le &\left( \alpha -   \theta^{2} \frac{|S|}{|V|} \right)^{-2} \lambda^{4} |S| \\
 |T|  \le &\left( \beta -   2 \theta \frac{|S|}{2|V|} \right)^{-2} 4\lambda^{2} |S|
 \end{matrix}
 \end{split}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*} 
  \begin{split}
   & \Delta^{1\frac{1}{2} + \varepsilon}|T| \le |x| \le  \Delta^{1\frac{1}{2}}|S| \\
   & |T| \Delta^{\varepsilon} \le |S|
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}
