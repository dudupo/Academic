\begin{definition}[$w$-Robustness] Let $C_{0}$ be code of length $\Delta$ with minimum distance $\delta_{0}\Delta$. $C = C_{0} \otimes \mathbb{F} + \mathbb{F}\otimes C_{0}^{\perp}$ will be said $w$-robust if any codeword $c \in C$ at weight less than $w$ it follows that $c$ is supported on at most $2\cdot w/\delta_{0}\Delta$ rows and cols.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[$p$-Resistance to Puncturing.] Let $p,w$ be integers. We will say that the dual tensor code $C_{A} \otimes \mathbb{F} + \mathbb{F} \otimes C_{B}$ is $w$-robust with $p$-resistance to puncturing, if the code obtained by removing (puncturing) a subset of at most $p$ rows and columns is $w$-robust.

\begin{theorem}
  For $\varepsilon \in \left( 0,\frac{1}{2} \right)$, $\gamma\in \left( \frac{1}{2} + \varepsilon, 1 \right)$, $\delta> 0$, large enough $\Delta$, and small codes $C_{A},C_{B}$ with distance at least $\delta\Delta$ if the dual tensor code of $C_{A},C_{B}$ is $w$-robust and $\Delta^{\gamma}$ resistance to puncturing, then there exists an infinite family of square complexes for which the Tanner code defined by the complexes and the dual tensor code is
