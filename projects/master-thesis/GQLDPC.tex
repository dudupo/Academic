\chapter{Good qLDPC Codes and LTC.}

The existence of good QLDPC codes and LTC were considered open problems for roughly two decades. Even though they seemed to be related only by containing the word "code" in their title, they were proven to exist by the same construction. They first appeared in \cite{Dinur} as good locally testable codes and not long after that in \cite{Pavel}, in which they also extended and derived the result to obtain the quantum code. Here, we follow the \cite{leverrier2022quantum} work, which simplifies the original proof and doesn't rely on any concept more complicated than what we already saw in the previous chapters. They also coined the term "Quantum Tanner Codes".


\section{Quantum Tanner Codes.}
Recall our insight that for a pair of LDPC codes to define a good CSS code, it must hold that neither of them is a good code, and moreover they both have a constant distance. Therefore, we understand that any codeword in $C_{X}$ that has small weight belongs to $C_{Z}^\perp$. To prove it, we are going to come up with a construction such that if $x \in C_{X}$ and $|x|$ is small then there is some small codeword $z \in C_{Z}^{\perp}$ such that $|x+z| < |x|$; by repeating this process recursively it follows that $x\in C_{Z}^{\perp}$. To formulate this theorem we will need the following definitions:
  
  \begin{definition} Let $C = \Tann$. We say that $x \in C_{\oplus}$ is \textbf{reducible} if there exists a vertex $v$ and a small codeword $c_v$, for which, adding the assignment of $c_v$ over the $v$'s edges to $x$ decreases the weight. Namely, $|x + c_{v}| < |x|$. If $x \in C_{\oplus}$ is not a reducible codeword then we say that $x$ is \textbf{irreducible} \label{ire}. \end{definition}

The next two definitions are concerned with the properties of the small code that will be set on the edges. Using them, one can characterize cases in which a local view can be reduced by subtracting a codeword from the dual code.

\begin{definition}[$w$-Robustness] 
Let $C_0$ be a code of length $\Delta$ with minimum distance $\delta_0\Delta$. $C = \duC $ will be said to be $w$-robust if for any codeword $c \in C$ of weight less than $w$, it follows that $c$ can be decomposed into a sum of $c = t + s$ such that $t \in C_A \otimes \mathbb{F}^{B}$ and $s \in \mathbb{F}^A \otimes C_B$, where $s$ and $t$ are each supported on at most $\frac{w}{\delta_0\Delta}$ rows and columns. For convenience, we will denote by $B'$ ($A'$) the rows (columns) supporting $t$ ($s$) and use the notation $t \in C_A \otimes \mathbb{F}^{B'}$.
\end{definition}

The definition we gave for $w$-Robustness is identical to the one stated by Zemor and Leiverar, but we also included the decomposition property in the definition. We refer the readers to the appendix section in \cite{Leiverar} for an existence proof by random construction. We mention that the random construction also gives the Gilbert-Varshamov bound.

\begin{definition}[$p$-Resistance to Puncturing.] Let $p,w$ be integers. We will say that the dual tensor code $C_{A} \otimes \mathbb{F} + \mathbb{F} \otimes C_{B}$ is $w$-robust with $p$-resistance to puncturing, if the code obtained by removing (puncturing) a subset of at most $p$ rows and columns is $w$-robust.   
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Quantum Tanner Code.]

%  Let $\Gamma$ be a group on $n$ verices. And let $A,B$ be a two generator set of $\Gamma$ such that if $a \in A$ ($B$) then also $a^{-1}\in A$ and that for any $g\in \Gamma,a \in A, b \in B$ it holds that $g \neq agb$ . Define the left right Cayley complex to be the graph $G = \left( \Gamma, E \right) $ obtain by taking the union of the two Cayley graphs generated by $A$ and $B$. So the vertices pair $u,v$ are set on square diaginal only if there are $a\in A$ and $b \in B$ such that $u = avb$. We can assume that $G$ is a bipartite graph (otherise just take $\Gamma^{\prime} = \Gamma \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}$ and define the product to be $a\left( u,\pm \right) = \left( au, \mp \right)$). 
%
%  Now divide the graph into postivie and negative vertices according their coloring $V^{-}$ and $V^{+}$. And define the positive graph to be $G^{+} = \left( V^{+}, E \right)$ and by $G^{-} = \left( V^{-}, E \right)$ the negative graph, when $E$denotes the sqaures, put it defrently their is an edge between $v$ and $u$ in $G^{+}$ if both vertices are positive and they are lay on the ends of square's diongal.
%
%  The quantum tanner code is a CSS code, such $C_{X}$ defined to be the classical tanner code $\mathcal{T}\left(G^{+}, \left(C_{A}^\perp\otimes C_{B}^{\perp}\right)^{\perp} \right)$ and $C_{Z}$ define as $\mathcal{T}\left(G^{-}, \left(C_{A}\otimes C_{B}\right)^{\perp} \right)$. Noice that in contrast to classical tanner code, in the quantum case it will be more convinent to think codewords as assiments set on the squaers and not on the edges.  
%
  Let $\Gamma$ be a group at size $n$. And let $A,B$ be a two generator set of $\Gamma$ such that if $a \in A$ ($B$) then also $a^{-1}\in A$ ($B^{-1}$) and that for any $g\in \Gamma, a \in A, b \in B$ it holds that $g \neq agb$. Define the left-right Cayley complex to be the graph $G = \left( \Gamma, E \right)$ obtained by taking the union of the two Cayley graphs generated by $A$ and $B$. So the vertices pair $u,v$ are set on a square diagonal only if there are $a\in A$ and $b \in B$ such that $u = avb$. We can assume that $G$ is a bipartite graph (otherwise just take $\Gamma^{\prime} = \Gamma \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}$ and define the product to be $a\left( u,\pm \right) = \left( au, \mp \right)$). 


Now divide the graph into positive and negative vertices according to their coloring $V^{-}$ and $V^{+}$. And define the positive graph to be $G^{+} = \left( V^{+}, E \right)$ and by $G^{-} = \left( V^{-}, E \right)$ the negative graph, where $E$ denotes the squares, put differently there is an edge between $v$ and $u$ in $G^{+}$ if both vertices are positive and they are laid on the ends of a square's diagonal.


The quantum Tanner code is a CSS code, such that $C_{X}$ is defined to be the classical Tanner code $\mathcal{T}\left(G^{+}, \left(C_{A}^\perp\otimes C_{B}^{\perp}\right)^{\perp} \right)$ and $C_{Z}$ is defined as $\mathcal{T}\left(G^{-}, \left(C_{A}\otimes C_{B}\right)^{\perp} \right)$. Note that in contrast to the classical Tanner code, in the quantum case it will be more convenient to think of codewords as assignments set on the squares and not on the edges.
\end{definition}

Now we can state formally the theorem: 

\begin{theorem}
  For $\varepsilon \in \left( 0,\frac{1}{2} \right)$, $\gamma\in \left( \frac{1}{2} + \varepsilon, 1 \right)$, $\delta_{0}> 0$, large enough $\Delta$, and small codes $C_{A},C_{B}$ with distance at least $\delta_{0}\Delta$ if the dual tensor code of $C_{A},C_{B}$ is $w$-robust and $\Delta^{\gamma}$ resistance to puncturing, then there exists an infinite family of square complexes for which the Tanner code defined by the complexes and the dual tensor code such that any codeword with weigh less than $ \frac{\delta_{0} n}{4\Delta^{3/2 + \varepsilon}} $ is reducible \cref{ire}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{claim}
  Consider a codeword $c$ such there exists a negative vertex $v$ that adjoins only for normal vertices. Then $c$ is reducible, and there exits $y \in C_{A}^{\perp}\otimes C_{B}^{\perp}$ such that $y$ supported only on $v$ and $ | c_{v} + y | < |c_{v}| $.       
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
 % Any row in the local view of $v$ can be thought as a codeword of $C_{B}$ plus faults made by adding $C_{A}\otimes \mathbb{F}_{2}$ to the corresponding sibling of $v$ regarding the row. As the dual tensor is $\Delta^{3/2+\varepsilon}$ robust. Then, \cite{kalachev2022twosided}       
\end{proof}


\begin{claim}
  The distance of the dual tensor code is at least $\delta\Delta$.
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
By the robustness property, any codeword of the dual tensor code with a weight less than $\delta_{0}\Delta$ is supported on at most one row. Let $c$ be such a codeword and denote by $i$ the number of the non-trivial row. Fix a $c^{\prime} \in C_{A}^{\perp}$ such that the $i$th coordinate of  $c^{\prime}$ is non-zero and consider the multiplication of $c$ with the codewords of $C_{A}^\perp \otimes C_{B}^\perp$ of the following form:
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
      J = \left\{ c^{\prime} \otimes c_{b} : c_{b}\in C_{B}^{\perp} \right\} 
    \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
  So the $i$th row of any $x \in J$ is a codeword of $C_{B}^{\perp}$ and in total, collecting all the $i$th rows of codewords in $J$ sums up to all the code words in $C_{B}^{\perp}$. On the other hand, $c\cdot x = 0$ for all $x \in J$; that is, $c\cdot x = c_{i} \cdot c_{b} = 0$. Thus we obtain that $c_{i} \in C_{B}$ and therefore $|c_{i}| \ge \delta_{0}\Delta \Rightarrow |c| \ge \delta_{0}\Delta$, which is a contradiction.
  %can be decomposed to a pairwise multiplication over the rows We obtain that only non trivial row must to be in $ \left( C_{B}^{\perp} \right)^{\perp}$ and there fore at weight at least $\delta_{0}\Delta$ and that is contradiction.  
\end{proof}

Denote by $S$ and $T$ the positive and negetive vertices support the codeword $x \in C_{x}$.

\begin{claim}
  \label{claim:epss}
  for any $\varepsilon \in \left( 0,1 \right)$ and large enough $\Delta$  it holds that $ |S| \le \Delta^{\varepsilon}|T| $ 
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose not, namely that $|S| > \Delta^{\varepsilon}|T|$, then $|x|/|T| > \Delta^{\varepsilon}|x|/|S| > \Delta^{\varepsilon} \cdot \delta_{0}\Delta $ But:  
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \frac{|x|}{|T|} = \frac{\Theta \left(E(T,T) \right)}{|T|} \le \Theta(\Delta^{2})\frac{|T|}{n}  + \Theta(\Delta)  \rightarrow_{n\rightarrow \infty} \Theta(\Delta)
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}
\end{proof}

\begin{claim}
  There is a negative vertex which adjoins to only normal vertices. 
\end{claim}
% Define the graph $G^{\star} = (V_{-}, E^{\star})$ such that $E^{\star} = E \cup \left\{ \left\{g, xyg \right\} x\neq y, \in A\cup B \right\}$ And notice that the assumption follows that  any 
\begin{proof}
  Denote by $S_{e},S_{n}$ the exceptional and the normal vertices. Namely the weight of the local view for any vertex in $S_{e}$ is grater than $\Delta^{3/2 + \varepsilon}$, and the normal vertices is the complementary vertices set. Suppose through contradiction that any negative vertex $v_{-}\in V_{-}$ has at least one sibling in $S_{e}$. Therefore $|T| \le \Delta |S_{e}|$ combining with \cref{claim:epss} it follows that $|S| \le \Delta^{1+\varepsilon}|S_{e}|$ : 
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
      \Delta^{3/2 + \varepsilon} & \le \frac{E(S,S_{e})}{|S_{e}|} = \Theta\left( \Delta^{2} \right)\frac{|S|}{n} + \Theta\left( \Delta \right)\sqrt{ \frac{|S|}{|S_{e}|}  }\\ 
      & \le \Theta(\Delta^{2}) \frac{|S|}{n} + \Theta(\Delta) \Theta\left( \Delta^{\frac{1+\varepsilon}{2}} \right)  
    \end{split}
  \end{equation*} 
 \end{proof}

 \begin{claim}
   Any $x \in \duC$ such that $|x| \le w$, and denote by $A^{\prime},B^{\prime}$ the rows and cols support $x$. Then $x$ can decompise into a sum of $x = t + s$ such that $t \in C_{A}\otimes \mathbb{F}^{B^\prime}$ and $s \in  \mathbb{F}^{A^\prime} \otimes  C_{B}$. 
 \end{claim}
 \begin{proof}
   By induction on the number of raws supported $x$. Denote $x$ by 

   \begin{equation*}
     \begin{split}
       x & = \sum_{i, c_{a}}{ c_{a} \otimes e_{i}  } + \sum_{i, c_{b} }{ e_{i} \otimes c_{b}} \\
       & =  c_{a^{\prime}} \otimes e_{\tau} + \sum_{i / \tau, c_{a}}{ c_{a} \otimes e_{i}  } + \sum_{i, c_{b} }{ e_{i} \otimes c_{b}} \\
      \end{split}
   \end{equation*} 
   
   Now, if $c_{a^{\prime}} \otimes e_{\tau}$ decrese the summation weight then it must holds that $x$  

    \begin{equation*}
     \begin{split}
       & =  c_{a^{\prime}} \otimes e_{\tau} + t^{\prime} + s^{\prime} = \overbrace{\left( c_{a^{\prime}} \otimes e_{\tau} + t^{\prime} \right) }^{ C_{A} \otimes \mathbb{F}^{B^{\prime}}}+ s^{\prime}
     \end{split}
   \end{equation*}
 \end{proof}
 
 \begin{claim}  
   Let $x$ be a codeword of $\duC$ such that $d(x, \mathbb{F}^{A} \otimes C_{B})$, $d(x, C_{A}\otimes\mathbb{F}^{B}) \le \xi < w$. Then $d(x, C_{A} \otimes C_{B}) < \xi $. 
 \end{claim} 
 \begin{proof}

 \end{proof}
\begin{claim}
  Suppose that $v \in T$ is sarounded by normal vertices. Then:
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
      d\left( c|_{v}, c_{A}\otimes C_{B}\right) < \Theta\left( \Delta^{1+\varepsilon} \right)
    \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
   
 \end{claim}
\begin{proof}
 \end{proof}
 
 \begin{remark}
 \end{remark}

\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \begin{matrix}
   \alpha  |S_{e}|  \le &\theta^{2}\frac{|S_{e}||S|}{|V|} - \lambda^{2}\sqrt{ |S_{e}||S| } \\
   \beta |T|   \le  &2\theta \frac{|T||S|}{2|V|} +2 \lambda\sqrt{ |T||S| }  
 \end{matrix}

 |S_{e}|  \le &\left( \alpha -   \theta^{2} \frac{|S|}{|V|} \right)^{-2} \lambda^{4} |S| \\
 |T|  \le &\left( \beta -   2 \theta \frac{|S|}{2|V|} \right)^{-2} 4\lambda^{2} |S|
 \end{matrix}
 \end{split}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*} 
  \begin{split}
   & \Delta^{1\frac{1}{2} + \varepsilon}|T| \le |x| \le  \Delta^{1\frac{1}{2}}|S| \\
   & |T| \Delta^{\varepsilon} \le |S|
