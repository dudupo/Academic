Both good quantum LDPC and good LTC had been open problems for more than decades, so the fact that they have been solved in one stroke raises two interesting questions. The first one is whether the construction that obtains each of them alone can also yield good quantum LTC? What is the exact challenge that prevents the inventors from proceeding into quantum testability?

The second question is whether one of the codes can be obtained without giving the other. Either positive or negative answers to these questions will shed light on our understanding of what quantumness is.

In this chapter, we present our attempts to provide answers. The chapter is divided into two parts. In the first, we demonstrate a variation of the classical Tanner code that defines many equations. We believe that this variation contains enough structure to guarantee degeneration of equations similarly to what occurs in the polynomial code. In the second chapter, we show that the polynomial code is not $w$-robust. If it were not the case, then one could hope to obtain quantum testability by considering a Tanner code in which any vertex restricts its local view to be a codeword of a quantum code.
