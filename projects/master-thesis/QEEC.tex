\section{Introduction.}
It's wide believed that quantum machines have a significant advantage over the classical in range of computational tasks\cite{grover1996fast}, \cite{ahuja1999quantum}. Simple algorithms, which could be interpreted as the quantum version of scanning all the options cut the running time by square root of the classical magnitude. 

Nevertheless, Shore shown a polynomial depth quantum circuit that solve the hidden abelian subgroup \cite{Shor_1997}, what is considered as breakthrough, as it made the computer science community to believe that a quantum computer might offer an exponential advantage. Yet, even those that there is a general consensus about the superiority of ideal quantum computation model,it is still unclear that it feasible to implement such machine in the presence of noise.    

In reality the error rate
