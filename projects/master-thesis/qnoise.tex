\begin{definition}[Bit and pahse flip.] \label{def:bphf}  
  Consider a quantum state $\ket{\psi}$ encoded in the computation base. We will say that a \textit{bit-flip} occurs in a scenario the operator Pauli $X$ is applied on one of our state's qubits. The bit-flip event could be considered as exactly as the standard bit-flip error in the classical regime. Similarly, \textit{phase-flip} occurs when the Pauli $Z$ is applied on one of the qubits. 

  \end{definition}

  % Notice that together with the identity $I$, the set $\{I, X \otimes e_{i} , Z \otimes e_{j} \}_{i,j \in [n]}$ span the matrices act on $n$ qubits.
