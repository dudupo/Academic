\section{Notations and Definitions.}

In this paper, we will be discussing the concept of binary linear error correction codes. These codes are used to detect and correct errors that may occur during the transmission of binary data. The notation used in this paper follows the standard conventions for coding theory, with the alphabet $\mathbb{F}_2$ representing the binary field and $n$ representing the length of the code. The code itself will be denoted as $C$, with the codewords represented as $c \in C$. The minimum distance of the code will be denoted as $d$, and the number of errors that can be corrected will be denoted as $t$. We will also use the notation $k$ to represent the dimension of the code, which is the number of information bits in each codeword. The parity check matrix of the code will be denoted as $H$, with the rows of $H$ representing the parity check equations. The generator matrix of the code will be denoted as $G$, with the rows of $G$ representing the codewords. Finally, the syndrome of a received word $r$ will be denoted as $s$, which is the result of multiplying $r$ by the transpose of $H$. These notations will be used throughout the paper to analyze and discuss the properties and performance of binary linear error correction codes.

\begin{definition}
  Let $C$, $\tilde{C}$ be linear binary codes at the same length, We will say that $\tilde{C}$ is a \trig in respect to $C$ if: 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\tilde{C} \subset C$
    \item $|x\cdot y \cdot z|$ is even for $x,y,z \in C$ such that at least one of $x,y,z$  belongs to $\tilde{C}$. 
    \item $|x\cdot y|$ is even for $x,y \in C$ such that at least one of $x,y$  belongs to $\tilde{C}$. 
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\section{The Construction.}

Let $x_{0}$ be a codeword of $\QQ$,  Denote by $w \in \mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}$
the binary string presents the $Z$-generator that anti commute with the
$X$-generator corresponds to $x_{0}$. Let $\mathcal{X} = \{x_{0}, x_{1}, .. x_{k^\prime}\} \in \mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}$ be a
subset of a base for the code $\QQ$. Such $\left(\text{ span } \mathcal{X}/x_0 \ \right)|_{w}$ is \trig code.  
Let us denote by $\Mbas$ the base $\{ y_{1}, y_{2}, .., y_{k^\prime} \} \in
\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}$ defined such: $ y_{i} = x_{j} + x_{0}$. 

Denote by $E$ the circuit that encodes the logical $ith$ bit to $y_{i}$, by $T^{(w)}$ the application of
$T$ gates on the qubits for which both $w$ and $x_{0}$ act non trivial, means $T^{(w\cap x_0)}$ is a
tensor product of $T$'s and identity where on the $i$th qubit $T^{(w)}$ apply
$T$ if $w_{i}$ and $(x_{0})_{i}$ are both $1$ and identity otherwise. And finally by $D$ denote the gate that decode binary strings in $\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}$ back into the logical space.

Let $\ket{\Mbas} \propto \sum_{x \in \text{span } \Mbas }{\ket{x}}$.
\section{Proof of Theorem 1.}
\begin{definition}
  Let $\Delta$ be a constant integer, $C_{0},\tilde{C}_{0}$ codes over $\Delta$ bits such $\tilde{C}_{0}$ is \trig and $C^{\perp}_{0}$ contains $\tilde{C}_{0}$, $C_{0}$ has parameters $\Delta[1,\delta_{0},\rho_{0}]$, and $C_{0}^\top$ has relative distance greater than $\delta_{0}$. Let $\Ctan$ be a Tanner code, defined by taking an expander graph with good expansion and $C_{0}$ as the small code. Let $\Cin$ be the dual-tensor code obtained by taking $(\Ctan^\perp \otimes \Ctan^\perp )^\perp$. Notes that first this code has positive rate and $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ distance, second this code is an LDPC code as well. Notice also that $\Cin^{\top}$ obtained by transporting the parity check matrix, and therefore equals to  $(\Ctan^{\top, \perp} \otimes \Ctan^{\top, \perp} )^\perp$. Hence $\Cin^{\top}$ has a square root distance as well.

  Let $Q$ the CSS code, obtained by taking the \Hyp of $\Cin$ with itself. So $Q$ is an quantum qLDPC code with parameters $[n, \Theta(n^{\frac{1}{4}}), \Theta(n)]$.
\end{definition}
\begin{claim}
  There exists family of non-trivial distance quantum LDPC codes $Q$ such the codes $\sMbas$ chosen respect to them has a positive rate. Furthermore, the rate of $\sMbas$ is a asymptotically converges to $Q$ rate:
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
      \left| \rho\left(Q\right) - \rho\left(\sMbas\right) \right| = o(1)
    \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
   Pick $x_{0}$ and $w \in \mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}$ , which correspond to the supports of anti commute $X$ and $Z$ generators, such that $w$ can be obtains by setting a codeword of $\Ctan$ on the first $n^{\frac{1}{4}}$ bits and padding by zeros the rest. Clearly, $|w| = \Theta(n^{\frac{1}{4}})$.

  Now for defying $\text{span }\mathcal{X}$, we are going to consider the parity checks matrix obtained by adding restrictions to $C_{X}$'s restrictions as follows: Divide the first $w$ bits into $\Delta$-size buckets, define by $w(i)$ the $i$th coordinate on which $w$ isn't trivial. For example if $w(1)=j$ then $j$ is the first nonzero coordinate of $w$, Denote by $B_{1},B_2,.., B_{|w|/\Delta}$ the partion of $w$'s bits: 
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
      B_{1} &= \left\{w(1), w(2), ..,w(\Delta)\right\}\\
      B_{2} &= \left\{w(\Delta + 1), w(\Delta + 2), ..,w(2\Delta) \right\}\\
      B_{i} &= \left\{w((i-1)\Delta + 1), w((i-1)\Delta + 2), ..,w(i\Delta) \right\}
    \end{split}
  \end{equation*}

  Then let $\text{span }\mathcal{X}$ be all the codewords of $\QQ$ satisfying $\tilde{C}_{0}$ restrictions for each bucket, Let us name the union of $\tilde{C}_{0}$ restrictions over the buckets by $B$. The dimension of the space satisfies both $C_{X}$ restrictions and $B$ is at least:
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
      \rho(C_{X})\cdot n - |B|\cdot (1 - \rho(\tilde{C}_{0}))\Delta \ge \rho(C_{X})\cdot n - n^{\frac{1}{4}}
    \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
  And by the fact that the dimension of $C_{Z}^\perp$'s codewords satisfying $B$ is strictly lower then $\dim C_{Z}^\perp$, we get the following lower bound:
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
      \dim \text{span } \mathcal{X} & \ge \rho(C_{X})\cdot n - n^{\frac{1}{4}} + \rho(C_{Z})\cdot n - n \\
     & \ge \rho (Q) - n^{\frac{1}{4}}
    \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  We emphasise that the above proof can be easily adapted to result the following for general CSS codes: 
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
      \left| \rho\left(Q\right) - \rho\left(\sMbas\right) \right| = d(Q)(1 - \rho(\tilde{C}_{0}))
    \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
  For example lets consider the quantum Tanner code. Since the distance of the quantum Tanner codes is $\sim n/\Delta$, where $\Delta^{2}$ is the degree of the square complex graph, (obtained by taking a codeword for which each local view of it is supported only on rows correspond to a specific single left generator), we get that for any $\rho \in (0,\frac{1}{2})$ one there is a good qLDPC such that the dimension of $\sMbas$ obtained respecting to it $\ge (1-2\rho)^{2}n - n/\Delta \cdot (1 - \rho(\tilde{C}_{0}))$.  
\end{remark}

\begin{claim}
  There is a family of quantum circuits $\mathcal{C}$ consists of Clifford gates and at most $o(\sqrt{n})$ number of $T$ gates such that: 
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
      T^{(w)}\ket{\Mbas + C_{Z}^{\perp}} \propto E \ \mathcal{C} \ \left(TH\right)^{\rho\left(\sMbas\right)n} \ket{0} 
    \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
  Let $\tau \in \sMbas + C_{Z}^\perp$, applying $T^{(w)}$ on $\ket{\tau}$ add a phase of $i\frac{\pi}{4}\left|\tau\right|_{w}$. Notice that $\tau$ can decompose to the sum of  $x_{0} + y + z$ when $y \in \text{ span } \mathcal{X}$ and $z\in C_{Z}^{\perp}$, so 

  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
  \left|\tau\right|_{w} &= \left| x_{0} + y _ z  \right|_{w} \\
  &= |x_{0}|_{w} + |y|_{w} +|z|_{w} - 2| x \cdot y |_{w} - 2| x \cdot z |_{w} -2| z \cdot y |_{w} + 4|x_{0}\cdot y \cdot z|_{w}  \\
  &= |x_{0} \cdot w| + |y|_{w} +|z|_{w} - 2|y|_{w} - 2|z|_{w} -2| z \cdot y |_{w} + 4|y \cdot z|_{w}  
    \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
  Since we picked $\tilde{C}_{0} \in C_{0}^{\perp}$ then $y \cdot z|_{w} = 0$ $\Rightarrow |y \cdot z|_{w}|$ is even.
\end{proof}


% Notice , So $x_{0}\cdot w = 1$ and for any other
%$x^\prime \in \mathcal{X}/x_{0}$ it holds that $x^{\prime}\cdot w = 0 $.
