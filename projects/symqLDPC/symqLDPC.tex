\title{Another reason that makes finding good quantum LDPCs a difficult task.} 
\author{David Ponarovsky}
  \maketitle
  
  \begin{claim}
Let $C_X/C_Z^{\perp}$ be a CSS qLDPC code with non-constant distance. Denote by $H_X$, $H_Z$ their parity check matrices and by $C_Z^{\prime}$, $H_Z^{\prime}$ the code and the parity check matrix obtained by removing one arbitrary check from $H_Z$. Then $C_X/C_Z^{\perp \prime}$ is a CSS pair with constant distance.
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
First, notice that any of the rows of $H_Z^{\prime}$ commute with the rows of $H_X$, so we definitely obtain a CSS code with higher rate. Second, any codeword of the quantum code $C_X/C_Z^{\perp \prime}$ has the form  
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \ket{\mathbf{x}} = \sum_{z \in C_Z^{\perp \prime}}{\ket{x + z}}
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}
Using the fact that the generator matrix of the dual of any binary code is the transposed parity check matrix of it, the above becomes:
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \ket{\mathbf{x}} = \sum_{z \in \mathbb{F}_2^s}{\ket{x + H_Z^{\top \prime}z}}
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}
Observe that because $C_X/C_Z^{\perp} \subset C_X/C_Z^{\prime \perp}$, we have also that the following state is in $C_X/C_Z^{\perp \prime}$:
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split} 
    \ket{\mathbf{x'}} = & \sum_{z \in \mathbb{F}_2^{s+1}}{\ket{x + H_Z^{\top}z}} \\
    =& \sum_{w \in \mathbb{F}_2}\sum_{z \in \mathbb{F}_2^s}{\ket{x + H_Z^{\top \prime}z + h'w  }} \\ 
    =& \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left( \ket{\mathbf{x}} + \ket{\mathbf{x} + h^{\prime}} \right)
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}
Where $h'$ is the check that was removed from $H_Z$ to obtain $C_Z^{\prime}$. Now let us give a quantum circuit that acts non-trivially on no more than a constant number of qubits and with probability $\frac{1}{2}$ transforms $\ket{\mathbf{x}}$ to $\ket{\mathbf{x'}}$. So first we prepare an ancilla in the $\ket{+}$ state, then controlled on its value we add $h'$. After that, we rotate back the ancilla by applying $H$ (Hadamard) again and measuring.

With probability $\frac{1}{2}$ we measure $\ket{0}$ and the remaining qubits hold the state $\ket{\mathbf{x'}}$. As $h'$ is also a check of the LDPC code $C_Z$, it has a constant weight and thus all the circuit touches a constant number of qubits. Therefore, the operator which transforms $\ket{\mathbf{x}}$ into $\ket{\mathbf{x'}}$ is supported only on Paulis with constant degree.     
\end{proof}
