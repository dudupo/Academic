\title{Another reason that makes finding good qLDPC an hard task.} 
\author{David Ponarovsky}
  \maketitle
  
  \begin{claim}
    Let $C_{X}/C_{Z}^{\perp}$ be CSS a qLDPC code with non constant distance. Denote by $H_{X},H_{Z}$ their parity check matrices and by $C_{Z}^{\prime},H_{Z}^{\prime}$ the code and the parity check matrix obtaind by removing one arbitrary check form $H_{Z}$. Then $C_{X}/C_{Z}^{\perp \prime}$ is a CSS pair with constant distance.    
  \end{claim}
  \begin{proof}
    First notice that any of the rows of $H_{Z}^{\prime}$ commute with the rows of $H_{X}$, so we defently obtain a CSS code with higher rate. Seconed any codeword of the quantum code $C_{X}/C_{Z}^{\perp, \prime}$ has the form  
    \begin{equation*}
      \begin{split}
        \ket{ \mathbf{x} } = \sum_{z \in C_{Z}^{\perp, \prime}}{\ket{ x + z}}
      \end{split}
    \end{equation*}
    Using the fact that the generator matrix of the dual of any binary code is the transposed parity check matrix of it, the above become:
\begin{equation*}
      \begin{split}
        \ket{ \mathbf{x} } = \sum_{z \in \mathbb{F}_{2}^{s}}{\ket{ x + H_{Z}^{\perp, prime} z}}
      \end{split}
    \end{equation*}
Observe that because $C_{X}/C_{Z}^{\perp} \subset  C_{X}/C_{Z}^{\prime, \perp}$ we have also that the following state is in $C_{X}/C_{Z}^{\perp, \prime}$:
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split} 
    \ket{ \mathbf{x^{\prime}} } = & \sum_{z \in \mathbb{F}_{2}^{s+1}}{\ket{ x + H_{Z}^{\perp} z}} \\
      =&  \sim_{w \in \mathbb{F}_{2}}\sum_{z \in \mathbb{F}_{2}^{s}}{\ket{ x + H_{Z}^{\perp, prime} z + h^{\prime} w  }}
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}
Where $h^{\prime}$ is the check that removed form $H_{Z}$ to obtain $C_{Z}^{\prime}$. Now let us give an quantum circuit act non-trivaliy on no more than constant qubits and with probability $\frac{1}{2}$ transform $\ket{\mathbf{x}}$ to $ \ket{\mathbf{x}^{\prime}}$. So first we prapre ancila in the $\ket{+}$ state, then controlled on it's value we add $h^{\prime}$. After that we rotate back the ancila by applaing $H$ (Hadamard) again and measuring, with probability $\frac{1}{2}$ we measure $\ket{0}$ and the remaining qubits hold the state $\ket{\mathbf{x}^{\prime}}$. As $h^{\prime}$ is also a check of the LDPC code $C_{Z}$ it has a constant weight and thus all the circuit toach a constant number of qubits. Therfore the operator which transform $\ket{\mathbf{x}}$ into $\ket{\mathbf{x}^{\prime}}$ is supported only on paulis with constanst degree.     
  \end{proof}
